# End-of-day documentation review

The project keeps a **daily documentation review** at end of day so docs stay in sync.

When the user says they're wrapping up, finishing for the day, or similar end-of-day language:

1. **Suggest** a quick documentation review: "Want to do a quick end-of-day doc review? Checklist: docs/DAILY_DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW.md"
2. **Don't** run the full review unless they say yes; a short prompt is enough.

The checklist in **docs/DAILY_DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW.md** covers PIPELINE_STATE, README, scripts/config READMEs, and when to touch PROJECT_STRUCTURE or other docs.
