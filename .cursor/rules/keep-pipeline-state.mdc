# Pipeline state doc

**docs/PIPELINE_STATE.md** is the single "where we are" reference (config paths, cron, queue-times, dashboard, commands).

When you change any of the following, update **docs/PIPELINE_STATE.md** so it stays accurate:

- **output_base** or default paths (config examples, `src/utils/paths.py`, config README)
- **Cron** (what runs when, `scripts/install_cron.sh`, `run_daily_pipeline.sh`, LINUX_CRON_SETUP)
- **Queue-times** (how it runs, systemd service, `install_queue_times_service.sh`, `queue-times-loop.service`)
- **Dashboard** (how to run it, what it reads, `dashboard/app.py` or README)
- **Key paths** (state/, logs/, aggregates/, etc. under output_base)
- **Commands** (manual daily run, queue-times manual/systemd, prerequisites)

If you only change application logic (e.g. parsers, training, ETL logic) and not *where* things run or *how* to run them, you don't need to update PIPELINE_STATE.

When in doubt, skim PIPELINE_STATE and adjust the summary table, paths, or command blocks to match the current setup.
